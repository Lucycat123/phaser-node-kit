I'll be the first to admit my time with _Phaser_ isn't vast. I'm still learning this awesome library day by day. 

If you spot a better way to do something, or a blantantly obvious mistake, please let me know by filing an issue on the GitHub repo at [https://github.com/develephant/phaser-node-kit/issues](https://github.com/develephant/phaser-node-kit/issues).

^_^ Happy Coding!
